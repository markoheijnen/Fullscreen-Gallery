A simple plugin that adds a fullscreen endpoint to display the gallery images

== Description ==

At this moment it only adds a gallery endpoint to posts with only one theme. In the next couple of weeks I will be looking at more solutions and build themes around those. I will then also start building a settings page where you can select what the default theme is and build a metabox where you can select per post what the options should be.

A demo can be seen at https://fesere.de/. If you go to https://fesere.de/african-wildlife/ you see it's a gallery provided by the theme and gets extended by this plugin. So when you go to https://fesere.de/african-wildlife/?fullscreen you see the same images but without the rest of the site. The plugin is so build that it should easily integrate in your existing theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `fullscreen-gallery` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Now go and watch this plugin by going to a post with a gallery and add `/fullscreen` to the url.
